# Introduction

While there are public cheats available for general users to choose, but there are also some cheats decided to go private for various reasons.

## Advantages of staying private

* Lesser chances of being detected
* Making your cheat more famous, since not anyone can get one easily.

And here are some examples of private cheats.

## Skeet / Gamesense

It has an un-hittable Anti-Aim and a 'godlike' resolver back during it's release. Despite nowdays there are lots of both private and cheats started to comes up with gamesense, it's still considered the top cheat for CSGO. Invite only. \[TODO:Skeet unhittableaa\]

## Fatality

\[TODO:Fatality logo+menu\] Fatality.win is another private cheat provider started in 2018. It is a HvH-focused cheat, which means it is lacking of legit features. It has a \[insert\] anti-aim and a \[insert\] resolver. Invite only, and haven't received updates for a while.

## Novolinehook

Novolinehook.com is a German private cheat provider started in 2017. It is an excellent cheat for players who are aimed to closet, legit, or even semirage cheating. It is mostly known for its ability to stay undetected, and has dodged many of the recent waves.

Novoline also has a league, and a private vesion (Hook of Ra). League version supports VAC, SMAC, EAC, CEVO, ESL WIRE (unstable), and FaceIT Serverside. Also, NovolineHook has an decent staff support, with fast HWID resets and willing to offer you remote support in certain cases.  

However the developers are reported to be lazy to push updates to the cheat. Also keep in mind that this is a legit-focused cheat, so you won't have a big chance against ragers. With that being said, it's resolver and legit anti-aim are still useful to fight against other semi-ragers.

This cheat is used to be open for application, however recently it has turned into invite only.

## Fanta

\[TODO:Fanata logo+menu\] Fanta.club is a Private legit cheat provider which mostly focuses on its semi-rage aspects. Although there are rumours claimed it is pasted from gladiatorcheatz, it is still considered one of the best semirage cheat and is a competitor to Novoline. It has had its fair share of detections, but performance wise its really good. The community is active and the devs are constantly making updates for the cheat. Invite only.

## ev0lve

Application and invites are available, with limited application slots. TODO
