# Linux and macOS cheats

Despite most cheat providers only provide their cheat software on Windows, there are still some open-source solutions for linux and macOS players. However keep in mind that these cheats would require the user, which is you to compile on your own. So it is recommend that you should have some experiences on computers before doing so.

Also you should be noticed that these open-source solutions usually dosen't come with a good reslover and rage aimbot for rage cheating, so just try avoid rage cheating on macOS and linux.

## Linux

Due to the different architchure deisgn compared to Windows, it makes VAC being limited to work as the same effective as on Windows. Thus this could allow a lot of cheats still going strong after years of inactive development.

[Fuzion](https://github.com/LWSS/Fuzion) is a linux cheat that is modified from aimtux, another CSGO cheat that was no longer maintained. It has legit and rage features available. However as mentioned from github, some users have reported that the cheat might be detected, so it is recommend to use other active public forks, like [MissedIT](https://github.com/HackerPolice/MissedIT).

## macOS

Due to macOS's security features, it is difficult for cheat developers to code a cheat on macOS, however this also applies to VAC, which it's functionallity are being limited due to the same reason.

[ButOSX](https://github.com/Lyceion/ButOSX) is technically not a "Cheat software", but instead a software base that could allow other cheat developers to work on it. It is the only public project that is in active development and support injecting on m1 chips. If you are interested in using macOS for CSGO cheating, you should follow on this project.

// TODO
NEED MORE INFORMATION ON THESE CHEATS. THEY MIGHT BE LEGIT, PASTES, OR FALSE INFORMATION
